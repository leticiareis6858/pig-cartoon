# Pig Cartoon

This repository is for one of the very first code I have ever made. It consists in a simple draw of a pig.
Pigs are my favorite animal and this code such as pigs, are really meanful to me.
A few months after making this code I caught a malware in my computer and I completely lost this simple code. But after almost three years of search, I finally found back this code.

## 🚀 How it was made

This code was made in Khan Academy's course of animation with code in javaScript. I made it back in 2020.
The code first was only the content in the 'example.js' file. But since it needed Processing.js to run, I had to adapt it to make it be able to be run with vs code. For that I just had to add the js code in a html file.

## 📋 Prerequisites

What do you need to run it?

```
VsCode
```

```
Live Code extension
```

## 🔧 Installation

Step to step of how to install it:

1. Click in <>Code

2. Download zip

3. Unzip the folder and place it somewhere in your computer

4. Open the folder with VsCode or other IDE of your choice

5. Do a right click somewhere in the 'index.html' file. Then click in 'Open with Live Server'.

## 🛠️ How to use it

After doing the installation, all you need to do is go to the browser tab that shall be automatically opened after opening the file with Live Server.
In this tab you will see the pig cartoon.
